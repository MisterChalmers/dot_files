# Mister Chalmers' Bash environment
My personal bash environment. 

When setting up a new workstation, I clone this repo and then hardlink `cp -al ~/git/dot_files/.bash_profile ~/.bash_profile`.

I usually work in macos, so you'll find a lot of if statements in here checking for "darwin" architecture. I haphazardly add to this. There's nothing fancy in it, but use at your own risk.
